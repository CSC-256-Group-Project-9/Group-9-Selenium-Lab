# High-Level Design (HLD) for Selenium Lab

## 1. Introduction

 - The High-Level Design provides a birdâ€™s eye view of the Selenium Lab, offering an architectural perspective of the lab's functionality based on the provided sub-SRS.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. Modular Design

- **Web Interaction Module:** Manages the direct interactions with web browsers through the Selenium WebDriver.
    Validation Module: Takes care of all the validations required for testing like page title validation, element presence, and so on.
    Report Generation Module: For compiling and generating test results after the completion of the test suite.
    Utilities Module: Handles miscellaneous functions like screenshot capture, logging, and data reading.

## 3. Data Flow

- **Input Data Flow:**
        The Web Interaction Module receives test instructions.
        This data then propagates to the Validation Module, where specific checks are performed.

- **Output Data Flow:**
        Post-validation, data moves to the Report Generation Module.
        Outputs are recorded, be it successful test results or error logs.

## 4. Database Design (if any)

- **Test Data Storage:** A simplistic database or file storage system for test data storage and retrieval. This is particularly useful for login tests or any other test requiring pre-set data.

## 5. User Interaction Interface

- **Test Script UI:** Simplistic Command Line Interface (CLI) that receives input on which test scripts to run, and then displays outputs or results post-completion.

## 6. System Components and Their Interactions

1. **Web Interaction Module:**
    - Interfaces directly with the browser using the Selenium WebDriver.
    - Sends and receives data from the Validation Module to ensure the tests are progressing as expected.
2.  **Validation Module:**
      -  Receives browser state and data from the Web Interaction Module.
      -  Sends validation results to the Report Generation Module.
3.  **Report Generation Module:**
       - Gathers test results and organizes them into coherent reports.
       - Interacts with the Utilities Module to integrate screenshots or logs if needed.
4. **Utilities Module:**
    - Works in the background, providing auxiliary support to all other modules. It might capture screenshots during test failures or maintain logs for debugging purposes.

## 7. Security and Exception Handling

- **Sandboxing:** Ensure that the testing environment is sandboxed to avoid any unintended side effects on the main system.
- Exception Handling Mechanism: Built into the Validation and Web Interaction Modules to catch typical web automation exceptions, such as ElementNotVisibleException, NoSuchElementException, and TimeoutException.

## 8. Scalability and Maintenance

- **Modular Design:** Facilitates easy addition of new test scenarios or functionalities without major alterations to existing modules.
- **Updatability:** The system will support updates to the Selenium WebDriver and any other tools utilized, ensuring compatibility with newer versions.

## 9. Conclusion

The High-Level Design for the Selenium Lab encapsulates the main architectural considerations for a smooth execution. It provides an organized and modular approach to tackling the challenges of web automation. As the lab evolves, this HLD can be revisited and revised to accommodate any new functionalities or changes.
