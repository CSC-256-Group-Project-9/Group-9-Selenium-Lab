# Group 9 Selenium Lab

This repository contains the information and resources needed for students to follow and complete the selenium lab. The [For-Students](For-Students) folder contains documents and resources that are to be delivered to students.

## Getting Started

- [Environment Setup](https://github.com/CSC-256-Group-Project-9/Group-9-Environment-Setup/blob/main/For-Students/getting-started.md) - First time setup instructions for students to follow before completing the lab.

- [Pre-Lab Instructions Template](https://github.com/CSC-256-Group-Project-9/Group-9-Environment-Setup/blob/main/pre-lab-instructions-template.md) - A template for documenters to use for adding pre-lab instructions for this lab.

## Notes

- **Environment setup instructions** have moved. The new instructions are at [Environment Setup Instructions](https://github.com/CSC-256-Group-Project-9/Group-9-Environment-Setup/blob/main/For-Students/getting-started.md) in the [Environment Setup](https://github.com/CSC-256-Group-Project-9/Group-9-Environment-Setup) repo. The example selenium code was moved to [Student-Examples/Example-1](Student-Examples/Example-1) and there is a new set of [instructions](Student-Examples/Example-1/instructions.md) for it.

- Some documents are labeled with a **DEV NOTE** which contains relevant information. These notes are **NOT** to be included in any final release.
