# Software Requirement Specification (Sub-SRS): Selenium Lab

## 1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose This sub-SRS provides a detailed software requirement specification tailored to the Selenium Lab, which is a part of the larger group project focusing on designing and implementing various software testing techniques using Python.

1.2. Scope This document details the requirements, functionalities, and non-functional attributes of the Selenium Lab.

1.3. Definitions and Acronyms

  - UI: User Interface
  - WebDriver: A collection of open-source APIs used for automating web application testing.

## 2. System Overview

2.1. Objectives of the Selenium Lab

  -Automate browser actions for web application testing.
  -Understand and utilize Selenium WebDriver using Python.
  -Validate web application UI elements and functionalities.

2.2. Tools & Technologies

  - Python
  - Selenium WebDriver

## 3. Functional Requirements

3.1. Web Browser Automation

- Automate tasks like opening a web browser, navigating to a webpage, clicking on links, filling forms, and closing the browser.

3.2. UI Element Interaction

- Identify and interact with various UI elements such as text boxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and checkboxes.

3.3. Validation

- Validate webpage elements to ensure that they display the expected values or behaviors.

3.4. Capture Screenshots

- Implement functionality to capture and store screenshots during test execution for result validation and error analysis.

3.5. Reporting

- Generate test execution logs or reports showcasing the passed, failed, and skipped tests.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

4.1. Performance

- Ensure swift execution of tests without unnecessary delays or lags.

4.2. Reliability

- Tests should be consistent and provide repeatable results.

4.3. Scalability

- Test scripts should be designed to accommodate potential future expansions or changes in the web application under test.

## 5. Environment & Setup

- Development & testing environment specifics, such as:
        Browsers supported (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
        Selenium WebDriver version.
        Python version.

## 6. Deliverables

  - Automated test scripts for specified test scenarios.
  - Documentation on:
        Steps to set up and run the tests.
        Explanation of each test script and its objectives.
  - Screenshots folder containing the captured images.
  - Test execution report.

## 7. Conclusion 
- The Selenium Lab will serve as a hands-on introduction to web automation, where students will leverage the capabilities of Selenium WebDriver using Python. By the end of this lab, students should be proficient in automating basic web interactions and validations, providing them with a solid foundation for more complex web testing scenarios.

## 8. Appendices

8.1. Sample Test Scenarios A list of some web applications or pages, along with their expected behaviors, which the students can use for initial testing.
