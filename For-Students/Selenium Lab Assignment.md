# Selenium Lab Assignment: Automating Browser Actions for Web Application Testing

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to automate browser actions using Selenium WebDriver for a web application with three distinct tests. By the end of this lab, you should be able to automate various interactions on a web application, including filling out forms, interacting with dynamic elements, and verifying results.

Before Testing, create the virtual environment if you haven't done so.

Before Automating, you need to manually test to have a better understanding of how these tests work.

## Test 4: Radio Button
1. Visit the web application.
2. Find Test 4.
3. Click each of the radio buttons and see the output by pressing submit.
4. Verify the output should reflect these changes.

## Test 5: Items to List
1. Visit the web application.
2. Find the input field in Test 5.
3. Type 1 object in the box and press click.
4. Repeat step 3 two more times.
5. Verify that the objects are being displayed under the click button.

## Instructions
1. Set up the Selenium environment.
2. Create separate scripts for each of the three tests (Test 4, Test 5).
3. For each test, automate the browser actions and interactions as described in the objectives.
4. Use assertions to verify the expected outcomes of each test.
5. Document your test scripts with comments explaining the purpose of each step.
6. Submit your Selenium scripts and any necessary configuration files.
